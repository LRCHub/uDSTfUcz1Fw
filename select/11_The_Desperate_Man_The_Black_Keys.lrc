[00:22.06] See her walkin' with a fella
[00:25.90] Two of them, so nice and mella
[00:30.86] Hey-hey, hey-hey, hey-hey-hey
[00:39.61] My heart is broken, it's open wide
[00:44.29] Feel so down deep inside
[00:48.76] Hey-hey, hey-hey, hey-hey-hey
[01:03.26] 
[01:15.98] Summer's here, but I'm still in fall
[01:20.37] Wonderin' what she done me for
[01:24.92] Hey-hey, hey-hey, hey-hey-hey
[01:34.02] I'm too far down the deepest ditch
[01:38.47] Too far gone to ever switch
[01:42.96] Hey-hey, hey-hey, hey-hey-hey
[01:57.46] 
[02:46.34] Drive all night now without a care
[02:50.87] Hope to catch you standin' there
[02:55.22] Hey-hey, hey-hey, hey-hey-hey
[03:04.36] Don't forsake a desperate man
[03:08.98] Hope you know that's who I am
[03:13.16] Hey hey, hey-hey, hey-hey-hey
[03:27.66] 
[03:46.85] One-two-three-four-five-six-seven-eight
