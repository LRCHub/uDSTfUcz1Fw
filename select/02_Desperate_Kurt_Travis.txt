I wanna keep you like this,
The perfect symbionts,
But we, we all seem to change,
We don't stay the same, I wanna freeze the frame,
Yeah you, simply know what you do, and I'm so afraid to lose,
I remember you used to light up the room,
To me you still do, I feel like i'm losing you,
I'm starting to get desperate, thinking that you'd forget,
And falling for me when I said, reciting novels that you read,
I'm starting to get desperate, thinking that you'd forget,
And falling for me when I said, reciting novels that you read,
And I'm so so so so afraid, afraid to lose you, yeah you
I'm starting to get desperate, thinking that you'd forget,
And falling for me when I said, reciting novels that you read,
I'm starting to get desperate, thinking that you'd forget,
And falling for me when I said, reciting novels that you read,
I'm starting to get desperate, thinking that you'd forget,
And falling for me when I said, reciting novels that you read,
I'm starting to get desperate, thinking that you'd forget,
And falling for me when I said, reciting novels that you read,
