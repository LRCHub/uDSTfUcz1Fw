Well, I shouldn't feel so messed up, oh lord
I ain't got no butter
I'm so far from home
Miss a blind baby, that's right
I gotta get back anyway I can
Get back home

Back on to get it
Back to baby
Get on and do it, do what?
Shing a ling come on
Desperate
I don't know if I'm coming or going
I'm going out of my mind

And you now it ain't right

Yeah!

You know it ain't right
Desperate
All night crying
Pillow's soaking wet

I'm going cold on the wall
I gotta get back home
I gotta get with my baby somehow

Well, I said I feel messed up babe
Can hear you me callin'?
And you know it ain't right
Yeow!
Ooh!
Desperate
Desperate
You know it ain't right

Desperate

You know it ain't right

Desperate

I got to get back home

Desperate

You know it ain't right

Desperate

Get back baby

Desperate

Gotta get back baby

Desperate

You know it ain't right
