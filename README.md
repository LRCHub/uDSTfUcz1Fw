```lrc
[00:25.22] A soldier alone
[00:27.97] Defending the border life
[00:35.29] His eyes on the run
[00:37.91] Looking for a place to hide
[00:42.41] And he's wondering why
[00:53.41] 
[00:45.12] Tears falling, he fades in the darkness
[00:50.52] Waiting for dawn to ease the pain, oh
[01:09.02] 
[00:57.70] Desperate, desperate night
[01:08.59] Desperate, desperate night
[01:14.86] He'll wait for the light
[01:26.86] 
[01:20.26] With blood on his hands
[01:22.94] The memories are all too clear
[01:30.11] To realize the truth
[01:32.97] Never makes it disappear
[01:37.41] Does anyone hear?
[01:45.91] 
[01:40.12] Death like a thief
[01:42.84] Comes without a warning
[01:45.54] Heroes die before the dawn, oh
[02:00.54] 
[01:53.61] Desperate, desperate night
[02:04.45] Desperate, desperate night
[02:09.88] He'll wait for the light
[02:21.88] 
[02:33.23] Desperate, desperate night
[02:45.06] Desperate, desperate night
[02:50.45] He'll wait for the light
[02:56.79] Desperate night
